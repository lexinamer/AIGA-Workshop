# AIGA-Workshop
 Add to Calendar Join us for a hands-on workshop where you can get down and dirty in the UI/UX process and leave with a tangible project for your portfolio!

## Branchless Bank
Branchless Bank is an online only bank for the digital era.

The creators of Venmo founded Branchless after seeing their platform handle billions of dollars in transactions since their founding in 2007. They realized that the rise of computers and smartphones could change the way that we do banking, and that with everything being digitized (including bill payment, money transfers, and check deposit), there is the market for a digital only bank.

Branchless is able to save customers money by avoiding the rising costs of brick and mortar stores.

### Potential Users
- Travelers who need their finances on the go
- Technologists who are tired of are traditional banking
- Bank customers who want the biggest bang for their buck

### Key Features
- Security and encryption
- Money transfer
- Check deposit
- Multiple types of accounts

### Platform
- Launching with web app (attendees will focus on mobile design)
- Later expand to dedicated iOS and Android apps

## The Plan
Your goals are to come up with a project plan and a proof of concept that you will then pitch to the founders (in 2 minutes or less). Note that this is supposed to be fast, iterative, and surface level and you won't have time to complete a masterpiece.
(That is part of the process)

**1. Strategy/Research [11:05-11:35]**
- Taking the concept, figure out target users (could be the ones in the brief or others) and pick one that they will focus on for the remainder of this project
- Any competitors and potentially a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis

**[BREAK 11:35-11:40]**

**2. Concepting/Wireframing  [11:40-12:10]**
- Figure out what the key features will be of the app (could be the ones in the brief or others)
- Narrow it down to top idea they will focus on
- Figure out what the task(s) will be for that feature and make sketches (notebooks, sticky notes) of the user flow to complete those tasks

**[BREAK/LUNCH 12:10-12:30]**

**3. Prototyping [12:30-1:15]**
- Use guides (if needed) to design the screens for your flow
- Then use those screens to create a click-through prototype in XD
- You probably wont have time for more than a few screens so they may need to improvise
- The BlankCanvas file includes a bunch of premade artboards and the UI-Kit file includes a bunch of ready made assets you can copy and paste into your blank artboards

**[BREAK 1:15-1:20]**

**4. Testing [1:20-1:40]**
- Swap computers with other groups to test their prototypes
- Each group gets 10 minutes and can provide feedback and other comments
(Note that there are different types of testing in real world)

**5. Implementation [1:40-1:50]**
- Briefly describe now how development would work (differences between front and back end) and explain that the designers arenâ€™t completely finished and might often have to iterate and work with developers through the implementation
- Talk about deploying or shipping a product

**Present [1:50-2:00]**
- You will will stand up and briefly talk/show about what they did


[Note: Lexi Prototype is a file that I created in about 15 minutes using assets from the UI kit to see an example]
